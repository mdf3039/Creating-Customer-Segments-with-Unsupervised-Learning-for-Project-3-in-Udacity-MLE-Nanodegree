    "**Answer: The averages(medians) for Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, and Delicatessen are 12000(8504), 5796(3627), 7951(4756), 3702(1526), 2881(817), and 1525(966), respectively. The medians fall far below the means for each ctegory. I conclude that most customers use significantly smaller amounts of monetary units relative to the mean, and there are few big customers who heavily influence the mean with large amounts of monetary units relative to the mean. Using quartiles for comparisons would most likely be best in this situation. For each customer, I will look at the quartiles of the features. Features in the first and fourth quartile show signs of potential unnecessity and necessity, respectively. The first customer falls in the uper quartiles (or close to it) for grocery, frozen, detergents_paper, and delicatessen. I would say this is one of the larger customers. This could be a fast food chain restaurant restaurant in a prime location, based on the large amounts of grocery and frozen relative to the median. The second customer falls in the lower quartile for fresh and delicatessen, but falls in the upper quartile for grocery and detergents_paper. I beliee this is a large customer as well, with a specific needs in groceries and detergents. This could be a grocery store. The third customer falls in the lower quartile for milk, grocery, and detergents_paper. Even though it barely falls in the upper quartile for frozen, I would say this customer is a small customer.

The advantages of using a Gaussian Mixture Model is that it can work with any distribution, the clusters can overlap, and it has a monotomically non-decreasing likelihood. Because of the uncertainty of the amount of clusters and the possible overlapping of clusters, I would choose a Gaussian Mixture Model. Clusters will most likely overlap because the differences between amounts of features in given places (such as restaurants and cafeterias) are not easy to pinpoint. Specifically, I would use a Dirichlet Process GMM since I do not know how many clusters.**"

When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data â€” if any. However, we can quantify the \"goodness\" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.\n",
